## About larger projects
This is a splash page, intentionally left simple. While smaller features (resource lists, design elements) can be added, larger suggested features (online magazine, wiki) require thorough discussion before approval to experiment.

Larger projects require:
- Attainable scope
- Clear editorial standards or moderation plan
- Technical schematics
- Dedicated maintainers and contributors
